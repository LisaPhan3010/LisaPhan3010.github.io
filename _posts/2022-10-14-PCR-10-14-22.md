# General PCR

## General Knowledge about PCR
- PCR reactions with reagents and samples should be placed on ice
- Every set of reactions should have a positive and negative control. Positive control is a reaction with DNA from a sample to amplify for the specific primers. Negative control is reaction with water.

**PCR Steps**
- Place reagents and samples on ice
- Names and sample number from 13 to 18

*Calculating the n number for reactions*
- n = number of samples + 2 + 0.1% for error
- In this case, n = 6 + 2 + 0.8 = 8.8

*Calculating components to make a master mix*
- Master mix is a mixture contains all things needed for PCR reaction except the DNA
- This helps to reduce variability
- 5 uL GoTag mix * n = 5 * 8.8 = 44
- 0.25 uL forward primer * n = 0.25 * 8.8 = 2.2
- 0.25 uL reverse primer * n = 0.25 * 8.8 = 2.2
- 3.5 uL molecular grade water * n = 3.5 * 8.8 = 30.8

- Add them all to make a mixture
- Vortex and spin down the master mix and place on ice
- All reagents should be vortexed and spinned down before using
- Set up strip tubes for each sample and the controls
- Label tubes with sanmple number, indication to primer, and date
- Add 9 uL of master mix to each strip tube
- Vortex and spin down all DNA samples
- Add 1 uL of DNA from each sample to their respective reaction tube
- Add 1 uL of molecular grade water to the negative control tube
- Add 1 uL of the positive control DNA to the positive control tube
- Vortex all strip tubes and spin them down

- Turn on the PCR machine and navigate to the needed program (already set up in the system)
- Close caps securely and place the strip tubes in the machine
- Make sure the green rach is on the correct side, all tubes are placed perfectly in holders
- Close the lid and start the program with a volume of 10 uL
- Record the run time on the screen
- After the process is done on the machine (12C), take the samples out and store at 4C on a labeled red rack
