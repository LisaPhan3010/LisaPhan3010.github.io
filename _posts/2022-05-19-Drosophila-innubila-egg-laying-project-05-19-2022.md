# Drosophila innubila Egg Laying

## Important information about the project

- Goal: trying multiple different types of agar plates to determine the best agar plate and the best age of flies where D. innubila lay the most eggs (these eggs are used to generate primary cell culture)
- D. innubila flies eat mushroom, but mushroom agar plates are hard to harvest eggs from anf the flies don't seem to like them
- They currently lay an acceptable amount of eggs on an apple juice plate with a small amount of yeast paste. We want to see if we can modify this recipe with mushroom liquid to get the flies to lay more
- Experimental plates:
+ Mushroom liquid replacing apple juice with no sugar added
+ Mushroom liquid replacing apple juice, with added sugar
+ Half and half mushroom liquid and apple juice with added sugar
+ All of these with and without yeast paste on top
- There are 6 different types of plates, and these plates will have to be tried 3 times independently each. This means flies can only be used once experimentally. We only have 4 small cages, so only 4 plates can be laid on at a time. There will be some modifications to the apple juice plate recipe
