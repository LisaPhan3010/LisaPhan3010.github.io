# Analysis of Mitotic Problem with TopoII a Replaced Cell Lines

**Wake Up Cells 9-13-2023**
- The first cell line to use in this project is TopoII a replaced with non-SUMOylatable mutant
- This time, 2 same cell lines are waken up.
- Take out frozen tube of cells and warm up
- Prepare 5cm plate and label date and name
- Use a 10 mL pipet, take 8 mL of media+FBS+TetON and
+ Add about 6 mL to a plate
+ Add the remaining about 2 mL to tube, suspend, and transfer to plate
- Mix the cells well
- Check under microscope
- Put cells into the incubator
- Throw away the tube

- 9-14-2023, change media for both plates (3mL for each)
