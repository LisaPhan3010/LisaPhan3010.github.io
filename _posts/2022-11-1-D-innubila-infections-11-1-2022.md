# D. innubila Infection with Bacteria

**Table of Infection**

**Vial Number**|**Treatment**|**Time Infected**|**Time on CO2**|**Number of Flies**|**Sex**|**Species**
:------:|:------------:|:---------:|:----------:|:-------------:|:------:|:-------------:
1|LB|4:30pm|6min|10|male|D. innubila
2|OD:1|4:38pm|7min|10|male|D. innubila
3|LB|4:46pm|8min|10|male|D. innubila
4|OD:1|4:55pm|8min|10|male|D. innubila
5|OD:1|5:03pm|6min|10|male|D. innubila
6|OD:1|5:09pm|6min|10|male|D. innubila


**Infection Preparation**
- The day before the infection day, separating D. innubila flies by sexes
- Choose vials of flies with age of 5-7 days and place them on the CO2 pad one by one
- Turn on the microscope and use a feather brush to separate them by sexes
- Put 12 males and 6 females into each vial (vials containing instant food, mushroom, and cotton)
- Wait for flies to wake and put vials back to a rack

**Infection Set Up**
- Use 95% ethanol to clean the working area including CO2 pad (turn it on first), microscope space, and desk
- Get two pieces of kim wipes and place in front of the microscope
- Prepare a rack with a OD:1 tube, LB tube, and 95% ethanol tube
- Get a infection needle and a probe tool and dip them into the ethanol tube and place them on the kim wipes
- Get notebook, pre-making vials, and new sugar agar vials ready

**Infecting Flies**
- Get new vials of sugar agar ready and label them with vial number, treatment, and species
- Take one pre-making fly vial and put on the CO2 pad and write down the time on the vial
- Separate them by sexes and ready for infection (only infect male flies)
- Use the needle and probe tool to poke the fly at the area under the wing
- Put 7-10 "infected" flies into the sugar agar vial, cover with a cotton plug, write the fly number on the vial, and set it on its side
- Write on the notebook with information including vial number, treatment, time infected, time on CO2, fly number, and species
- Move on to the next vial
- After flies wake up, place vials into a rack and label it
- Clean working space with ethanol
- Throw the infection needle in the sharps box
- Dispose the bacteria and LB tubes in the autoclave trash

**Checking for Survival**
- Check for fly survival for seven days after infection at the same time
- Record the number of flies alive for each vial in the notebook
- Transfer flies to new vials every 3-4 days
- After 7 days, all vials can be discarded in the fly trash

**Additional Info**
- Clean the probe and needle after every infection by dipping in the ethanol tube
- The infection needle needs to be dipped into the infection liquid before each infection
