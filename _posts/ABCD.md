# Analysis of Mitotic Problem with TopoII a Replaced Cell Lines

**Wake Up Cells 9-13-2023**
 3 coverslips on each dish (2 dish total)

- 9-20-2023, 9:30am, split cells from 5cm dish to 2 of 5cm dishes with coverslips (60% confluent)
- From 1 dish of 70% and 1 dish of 100%
- 9-20-2023, 1pm, add 2mM thymidine and treat them for about 18-22 hours
- 3mL/50 = 3000uL/50 = 60uL each (stock 100mM)
- 9-21-2023, 9-10am, release from thymidine by washing cells with media (w/o FBS) 3 times, ~5min each and then add media with FBS
- Add Aux/ Dox as per the experiment
- Add Aux 0.5mM, 3mL/1000 = 3000uL/1000 = 3mL
- Add Dox 1uL/mL, 1uL Dox/ 1000uL media = a, then 3000uL/100 = 30uL of a
- 9-21-2023, 5-6pm, after 8-9 hr, fix the cells
