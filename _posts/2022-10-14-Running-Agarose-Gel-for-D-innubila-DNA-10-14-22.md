# Running Gel for DNA Practice

## Knowledge about Running Gel

- Agarose gels are used to visualize DNA, usually after PCR or other enzymatic reaction.
- DNA is loaded into wells in the gel and pulled through the gel matrix with a positive charge current.
- The DNA is stained and visualized under UV light.
- The size of the gel depends on the number of samples runned.
- The percentage of the gel depends on the expected band size of the DNA learned.

*Note*
- The DNA stain is often mutagenic. It is an agent that attach into DNA to glow, can also damage DNA.
- Thus, it is important to wear gloves.
- The UV light is also harmful.
- Make sure to cover the light box with the plastic cover.

## Gel Sizes and Specifications:

### Small Square Gel:

- Maximum number of samples: 11
- Number of ladder spaces: 1
- Volume needed: 20 mL
- Volume gel stain needed: 0.5 uL
- How to cast: use casting trays, fit the base into the square spot

### Small Rectangle Gel:

- Maximum number of samples: 24
- Number of ladder spaces: 1
- Volume needed: 30 mL
- Volume gel stain needed: 0.75 uL
- How to cast: use casting trays, fir the base into the rectangle spot

### Fisher Tall Rectangle:

- Maximum number of samples: 14
- Number of ladder spaces: 2
- Volume needed: 40 mL
- Volume gel stain needed: 1 uL
- How to cast: Turn sideways in the gel box and slide down half way, using the rubber liners to make a seal. Use the level on top of the scale to make sure it is flat. Not pushing dowm all the way makes it easier to take out.

### Large Rectangle (Red Stripes):

- Maximum number of samples: 38
- Number of ladder spaces: 2
- Volume needed: 70 mL
- Volume gel stain needed: 1.5 uL
- How to cast: use the black rubber bumpers to push in and seal the edges of the tray

### Largest Clear Rectangle:

- Maximum number of samples: 96
- Number of ladder spaces: 4
- Volume needed: 165 mL
- Volume gel stain needed: 5 uL
- How to cast: Use lab tape to make a seal around the edges. Put tape along the sides and seal it very tight by pushing a fingernail along the tape multiple times until you feel like it is sealed properly.

## Steps:

**Making Gels**

- Determine the % needed, usually 1-3%
- Determine the volume of gel liquid needed
- Depending on the volume, choose the appropriate certain sized Erlenmyer flask for best results:
+ 20-40 mL: 125 mL flask
+ 40-100 mL: 250 mL flask
+ 165 mL: 500 mL flask
-Based on the volume needed and the percentage gel, determine the needed agarose:
+ Example: 100 mL of a 1% gel needs 1 g of agarose
+ In this case, 0.2 g of agarose is needed (actually amount measured is 0.2018 g)
- Measure the agarose using the balance with a weight boat and scooper
- Pour the agarose into the desired dry Erlenmyer flask
- Measure the volume of 1X TAE needed needed for the liquid in the 100 mL graduated cylinder on the self
+ In this case, 20 mL of 1X TAE is used
+ 1X TAE can be made from water and 30X TAE
- Pour into the flask and swirl gently to mix the agar and liquid
- Put in the microwave
- Press time/ temp, 7 for the power, and 1 minute for the time (more liquid volume needs more time, and more % needs more time)
- Swirl to mix and check carefully to see any bubbles and flakes. The liquid should be completely dissolved and clear. Chips are very hard to see. These chips make the liquid not homogenous and DNA move differently, affect results. Can microwave more if needed.
- Wait to cool down (1 min, 3-5 min, 5-10 min) before pouring to the tray
- Add an appropriate amount of DNA gel stain (lab solution), 0.5 uL in this experiment before pouring (kept at 4C and shoould be in liquid state) to the liquid flask and mix
- Gently pout the liquid into the casting tray, avoid bubbles
- Put the comb in and make sure it is sitting in evenly (can be before pouring liquid if prefered)
- USe the pipettee tip to move bubbles to the side or bottom if needed
- Wash the flask immediately in tap water, then DI water
- Wait 10-15 minutes for it to solidify

**Loading the Gel**

- Gently take the combs out vertically and rinse in DI water and place to dry
- Take the tray out of the casting device, remove tape
- Fully submerge the gel in the gel box in 1X TAE buffer (can add more if needed). Make sure the wells are on the side of the box with the black electrode (negative charge). DNA is negative charged and will move to the potive charge (red)
- Red and purple papers help to see the wells clearer
- Load 3 uL of ladder (Gene ruler 1 kb plus ladder or other types) into the first well
- Load in 5 uL of other samples (8 in this case) in a known order, put other ladders if needed
- Close the lid of the gel box
- Plug it into the power station with color matching
- Change the time and voltage (volt is "like" speed, over 100 is too fast)
- In this case, 35 minutes at 90 V
- After starting the power station, make sure to see bubbles in the gel box

**Imaging the Gel**

- Turn off the power station, unplug the wires
- Take the tray out and take to the imager
- Slide the gel onto the UV light box without touching (can use extra gloves to avoid EtBr contamination)
- Rinse the tray in DI water and place to dry
- Cover the gel box
- Turn off the room light
- Turn the UV light on with extra gloves and take picture using phone
- Turn off UV light, take off the cover
- Place the gel in the gel trash bucket
- Rinse the light box with DI water, wipe with paper towel
- Put trash into the second trash bucket with gloves
