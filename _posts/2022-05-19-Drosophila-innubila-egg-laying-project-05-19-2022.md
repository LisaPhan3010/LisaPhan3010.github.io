# Drosophila innubila Egg Laying

## Important information about the project

- Goal: trying multiple different types of agar plates to determine the best agar plate and the best age of flies where D. innubila lay the most eggs (these eggs are used to generate primary cell culture)
- D. innubila flies eat mushroom, but mushroom agar plates are hard to harvest eggs from anf the flies don't seem to like them
- They currently lay an acceptable amount of eggs on an apple juice plate with a small amount of yeast paste. We want to see if we can modify this recipe with mushroom liquid to get the flies to lay more
- Experimental plates:
+ Mushroom liquid replacing apple juice with no sugar added
+ Mushroom liquid replacing apple juice, with added sugar
+ Half and half mushroom liquid and apple juice with added sugar
+ All of these with and without yeast paste on top
- There are 6 different types of plates, and these plates will have to be tried 3 times independently each. This means flies can only be used once experimentally. We only have 4 small cages, so only 4 plates can be laid on at a time. There will be some modifications to the apple juice plate recipe

## Experimental Design Layout

- Independent variables (experimental variables): mushroom plate type (including or not including yeast), age of flies in cage
- Dependent variables (measured): number of eggs of each plate
- Constants: number of flies in each cage, sex ratio of flies in each cage, amount of time flies have to lay
- Controls: laying plates with only apple juice or apple juice and yeast paste - testing mushroom on the plate for laying preferences, so plate with no mushroom is a good control
- Random sampling: flies are chosen randomly from vials, plate type is randomized for for each day of laying
- Biological replicates: each plate type has 3 independent replicates
- Independence: flies that have laid eggs on the plates previously are not used again for the experiment

## Steps of the experiment

*Make plates and let set 1-2 hours on bench and sit for at least overnight in the fridge*
- Mushroom broth with no sugar
- Mushroom broth with sugar
- Mushroom broth and apple juice with sugar
- Apple juice
*If plates need yeast spread: spread yeast on plates at least 1 day before using*
*At least 1 day before setting up flies in cages*
- Make 4 new vials of food (temporary vials)
- Randomly pick 3 males and 6 females from the desired age (2 or 3) and put them in each one of the new temporary vials
*At a set time (4-5pm) set up cages*
- Use the randomized set of 4 plates
- Label the plates with the unique abbreviation on the side
- Add the pre-separated flies to the cages
*Next day (4-5pm), stop cages and photograph eggs*
- Make 2 new vials of food and label with the passage number 1+ the number from the the flies original vials
- Put 2 cages of flies to sleep on CO2 pad and place into 1 vial, then repeat for the second vial
- Label these vials "NON-experimental flies" so they don't get used for another cage experiment
*Count the eggs and document them*

## Egg counting protocol
- Stop the experiment at the designated time so that all experimental plates get roughly the same amount of time
- Plates are covered with the petri dish cover once exposed so no other flies can get to them
- Pick off any dead or stuck flies on the plates
- Place the platre on a holder
- Photograph the plate code, four quadrants A, B, C, D
- Take photos of quadrants using a microscope
- Each quadrant is counted 3 times, but not consecutively
