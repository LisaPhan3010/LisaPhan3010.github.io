# Analysis of Mitotic Problem with TopoII a Replaced Cell Lines

**Wake Up Cells 9-13-2023**
- The first cell line to use in this project is TopoII a replaced with non-SUMOylatable mutant
- This time, 2 same cell lines are waken up.
- Take out frozen tube of cells and warm up
- Prepare 5cm plate and label date and name
- Use a 10 mL pipet, take 8 mL of media+FBS+TetON and
+ Add about 6 mL to a plate
+ Add the remaining about 2 mL to tube, suspend, and transfer to plate
- Mix the cells well
- Check under microscope
- Put cells into the incubator
- Throw away the tube

- 9-14-2023, change media for both plates (3mL for each)

- 9-18-2023, change media for both dish, the other dish split (take out 75% to 10cm dish)

**Cell Staining**

- 9-19-2023, 4pm, coat coverslip with Poly D-lysine
- Add coverslip on plate with 95% ethanol to wash
- Flame them
- Put coverslip on dish, add poly D-lysine enough to cover for abour 1 hour (recycle Poly D-lysine)
- Remove Poly D-lysine and leave coverslip dry overnight
- Total 3 coverslips on each dish (2 dish total)

- 9-20-2023, 9:30am, split cells from 5cm dish to 2 of 5cm dishes with coverslips (60% confluent)
- From 1 dish of 70% and 1 dish of 100%
- 9-20-2023, 1pm, add 2mM thymidine and treat them for about 18-22 hours
- 3mL/50 = 3000uL/50 = 60uL each (stock 100mM)
- 9-21-2023, 9-10am, release from thymidine by washing cells with media (w/o FBS) 3 times, ~5min each and then add media with FBS
- Add Aux/ Dox as per the experiment
- Add Aux 0.5mM, 3mL/1000 = 3000uL/1000 = 3mL
- Add Dox 1uL/mL, 1uL Dox/ 1000uL media = a, then 3000uL/100 = 30uL of a
- 9-21-2023, 5-6pm, after 8-9 hr, fix the cells

Cell fixation and staining

- Take cells out from the incubator and wash with 2ml 1X PBS
- Fix cells with 4%paraformaldehye for 1omin
- Wash cells again with 2ml 1X PBS
- Add ice-cold methanol for cell permeabilization for 10min.
- Take methanol out and add 2ml 1X PBS-T
- Add 2.5% gelatin-blocking solution for 30min.
- Take out the coverslips and put into the box
- Add primary antibody solution for 1 hour -3hr or O/N (depending on Ab)
- Wash with 1X PBS-T 15min each wash- 3times
- Add secondary antibody solution for 1 hour- keep in the dark
- Wash with 1X PBS-T , 15min each wash- 3times
- Mount with DAPI.

- Note: prepare antibody in the same blocking solution and centrifuge at 4C for 15min at 25k rpm and use supernatant for experiment.
