**Homogenization**
- Chill the cell lysis solution in an ice bucket until it becomes cloudy
- Turn the heat blocks on to desired temperature (65C and 37C)
- Place the fly samples on ice
- Add 100 uL of cell lysis to each fly tube (change pipetting tip everytime to avoid precipitation and contamination)
- Homogenize each fly with motorized pestle for approximately 5 seconds each. To break up the flies, gently move the pestle up and down in the tube (each fly, each clean autoclaved pestle). This step helps to break down the tissue
- Clean the pestles with bleach and water
- Use the mini-centrifuge to spin down the homogenized fly tubes

**Cell Lysis**
- Heat the tubes in the heating block at 65C for 15 minutes (red lid)
- Make a diluted solution of DNase A from 100 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL (1:100 dilution, 1 uL in 99 uL molecular grade water). The component with larger volume should be added first. Rotate and spin down the solution and place in ice. This solution is single used because its activity decreases over time.
- After heating/ incubating, the tubes of samples are allowed to cool down in room temperature
- Add 2 uL of diluted DNase A to each tube
- Invert tubes for 25 times (whole rack) and spin down tubes usinf mini centrifuge
- Incubate tubes in the heat block for 40 minutes at 37C
- After that, cool these tubes in roome temperature (after preparating final tubes)

**Final Tubes Preparation**
- These tubes should be fresh for everyday use
- Make 1 new 1.5 L tube for each sample
- Add 100 uL of fresh 100% isopropanol to each tube
- Label the tubes with sample name, extraction number, "DNA", date, and initial "Huan" on the lid and side as well
- Make fresh 70% ethanol by mixing 10.5 mL of 100% ethanol with 4.5 mL molecular grade water

**Protein and Debris Removal**
- Add 33 uL of protein precipitation solution to each tube
- Vortex tubes for 10 seconds each
- Place tubes on ice for approximately 5 minutes
- Centrifuge tubes at 14,000 rpm (13,300 rpm) in 3 minutes

**DNA Precipitation and Purification**
- Transfer supernatant to the final tubes with isopropanol in them (try not to pipettee up the debris in pellet). The volume should be 130 uL
- Gently invert tubes for 50 times (whole rack) and centrifuge at 14,000 rpm (13,300 rpm) for 5 minutes. Make sure they are placed in the same direction
- Check all tubes for a DNA pellet, this may not be visible
- Pour off the supernatant (liquid) from pellet
- Add 100 uL of prepared freshly 70% ethanol to each tube (to the side)
- Invert tubes for 2 times and centrifuge at 14,000 rpm (13,300 rpm) for 1 minute
- Discard supernatant (pour off the liquid)
- Let these tubes dry on a kim wipe on the bench for about 30 minutes/ 1 hour
- Resuspend pellets in 20 uL DNA hydration solution
- Leave DNA suspend overnight
- On the next day, freeze DNA at -20C for future use
- DNA can be used to check concentration (Qubit) or directly into a PCR
