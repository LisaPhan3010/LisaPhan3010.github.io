# Cell Work

**Cell Split**
*Notes*
- This protocol is for 5cm dish. It is different amount for 10cm dish (x2), 3cm dish.
- Check water level and temperature of the incubator regularly.
- Check ethanol, bleach, waster flask regularly.
- The doubling time for these cells are approximately 24 hours, growth rate is x2/ day.
- Confluency: 6.25% 24 hours 12.5% 24hrs 25% 24hrs 50% 24hrs 100% confluent.
*Protocol*
- Carefully wipe all tools and working area with 70% ethanol.
- Turn the hood on.
- Have all necessary materials warm up in room temperature in about 20 minutes (Trypsin, media+FBS).
- Turn the vacuum on. Using a pipet and a small tip, suction all media from the plate.
- With a pipette, add 500 uL of Trypsin to wash FBS.
- Remove the used Trypsin and add 1 mL of Trypsin.
- Incubate the plate in a 37C, 5% CO2 incubator for 10 minutes.

- Now, cells are floating and can be seen under microscope.
- Add 1 mL of media.
- Suspend cells using a pipette. Repeat it up and down for about 20 times.
- Transfer a necessary amount of cells (liquid) based on the confluency into another plate (or can be discard if needed, use the previous plate only).
- Add media into plates. 3 mL for 5 cm dish, 10 mL for 10 cm dish, and 1.5 mL for 3 cm dish.
- Mix the cells well.
- Write passage number (do not pass 20) and date and name.
- Put it back to the incubator.
- Put all materials back to the fridge.


**Wake Up Cells**
- Take out frozen cells and warm up.
- Prepare plates.
- Add media to plates and get ready.
- Add media+FBS to tube, suspend, and transfer into prepared plate.
- Check under microscope.
- Put back to incubator.

**Making Cell Stock**
- Cell split steps
- Transfer to tube
- Centrifuge for 5 min at 4000 rpm to see pellet
- Store the remaining cells in plate and put back to incubator
- Can make 3-4 stock tubes, label
- Remove media from tubes wthout touching pellet
- Add x3x950 uL of media to tube and 150 uL of DMSO
- Mix well
- Divide 1mL to each small tube
- Put in freezer

**Making Agar Gel - Recycle**
- Put all used gells into a Erlenmeyer flask with stiring bar
- Add 1X TAE 200 mL
- Heat up using microwave 1 min
- Stir while waiting for it to cool down 10 min
- Add 6-7 gel stain, stir, pour into prepared tray with comb
