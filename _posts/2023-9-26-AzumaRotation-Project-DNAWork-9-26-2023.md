# DNA Work - Cutting Promoter from 1 Plasmid and Insert into Another Plasmid

**Digestion of Plasmids 9-26-2023**
:--------:|:---------:|:----------:
-|1139/ 1359(redo)|1361/ 1362
DNA|10 uL|3 uL
NheI enzyme (green mark)|1 uL|1 uL
SalI enzyme (green mark)|1 uL|1 uL
CutSmart buffer|2 uL|2 uL
H2O|6 uL|13 uL
Total volume|20 uL|20 uL

- Mix them well in 3 separate 1.5 mL tubes, vortex, centrifuge and put into incubator at 37C overnight
- List of used plasmids
+ YA 1139: CCR5 PICH 12128A
+ YA 1361: CCR5 PICH T1003A
+ YA 1362: CCR5 PICH 12128A/ d35IM
- 1139 is insert, 1361 and 1362 are vectors

- 9-27-2023
- Run 1 uL of digested plasmids (all 3 plasmids) to check digestion
- Mix 1 uL DNA and 1 uL of 2X loaddye
- Add 2 uL of ladder to the first well of the gel
- Run at 110V about 20 min in 1X TAE
- Take picture and check bands using D-DiGit, expecting to have 2 bands for each, 1139-use the second band, 1361 and 1362 use the first band

- Then, run all 19 uL DNA and 3 uL loaddye for all 3 samples and see bands for 1361, 1362

- Using 1359 instead of 1139 (out of stock) for redo the experiment
- Start again from digestion step 9-28, run gel 9-29, not good results (19uL left), add 1uL NheI, 1uL SalI, 2.5uL CutSmart, 1.5uL H2O for total 25 uL, incubate for hours and run gel

- For 1361 and 1362, extract gel DNA as bars shown
- Follow steps in QiAquick Gel Extraction Kit
:-----:|:-------:
1361|1362
1.37-1.16 (tube) = 0.21=210 ug|1.36-1.16=0.2=200 ug
630 uL QG buffer|600 uL QG buffer
- Elute with 20 uL H2O, wait 5 min and centrifuge

- Run gels of 1361 and 1362 (1uL each), still see no results
- Run again with 4 uL, see results, not too good
- Reprepare 1361 and 1362, stretch on AmpR plate and leave for grow overnight
- Warm up AmpR plate in incubator 5-10 min
- Use autoclaved toothpick to get a tiny amount and stretch Z motion
- Put used toothpick into beaker for later clean
- Close freezer, incubate plate at 37C to form colonies overnight

- 9-29 make liquid culture: 3mL Amp media and 2 tips of isolated colony, white cap
- 9-30 DNA extraction, elute 30 uL H2O, digestion 10uL DNA for total 20 uL
- Run gel 1 uL to test
- 10-3 ligation
- Use 1359, previous 1361 and 1362 disgestion

- 10-9, check 1359/1362 ligation/digestion

- Prepare to redo whole experiment
