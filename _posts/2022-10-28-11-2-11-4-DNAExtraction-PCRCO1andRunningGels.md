**Homogenization**
- Chill the cell lysis solution in an ice bucket until it becomes cloudy
- Turn the heat blocks on to desired temperature (65C and 37C)
- Place the fly samples on ice
- Add 100 uL of cell lysis to each fly tube (change pipetting tip everytime to avoid precipitation and contamination)
- Homogenize each fly with motorized pestle for approximately 5 seconds each. To break up the flies, gently move the pestle up and down in the tube (each fly, each clean autoclaved pestle). This step helps to break down the tissue
Use the mini-centrifuge to spin down the homogenized fly tubes
**Cell Lysis**
- Heat the tubes in the heating block at 65C for 15 minutes (red lid)
- Make a diluted solution of DNase A from 100 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL (1:100 dilution, 1 uL in 99 uL molecular grade water). The component with larger volume should be added first. Rotate and spin down the solution and place in ice. This solution is single used because its activity decreases over time.
- After heating/ incubating, the tubes of samples are allowed to cool down in room temperature
- Add 2 uL of diluted DNase A to each tube
- Invert tubes for 25 times (whole rack) and spind down tubes usinf mini centrifuge
- Incubate tubes in the heat block for 40 minutes at 37C
- After that, cool these tubes in roome temperature (after preparating final tubes)

**Final Tubes Preparation**
- These tubes should be fresh for everyday use
- Make 1 new 1.5 L tube for each sample
- Add 100 uL of fresh 100% isopropanol to each tube
- Label the tubes with sample name, extraction number, "DNA", date, and initial on the lid and side as well
- Make fesh 70% ethanol by mixing 35 mL of 100% ethanol with 15 mL molecular grade water

**Protein and Debris Removal**
- Add 33 uL of protein precipitation solution to each tube
- Vortex tubes for 10 seconds each
- Place tubes on ice for approximately 5 minutes
- Centrifuge tubes at 14,000 rpm (13,300 rpm) in 3 minutes

**DNA Purification**
- Transfer supernatant to the final tubes with isopropanol in them (try not to pipettee up the debris in pellet). The volume should be 130 uL
- Gently invert tubes for 50 times (whole rack) and centrifuge at 14,000 rpm (13,300 rpm) for 5 minutes. Make sure they are placed in the same direction
- Check all tubes for a DNA pellet, this may not be visible
- Pour off the supernatant (liquid) from pellet
- Add 100 uL of prepared freshly 70% ethanol to each tube (to the side)
- Invert tubes for 2 times and centrifuge at 14,000 rpm (13,300 rpm) for 1 minute
- Discard supernatant (pour off the liquid)
- Let these tubes dry on a kim wipe on the bench for about 30 minutes/ 1 hour
- Resuspend pellets in 20 uL DNA hydration solution
- Leave DNA suspend overnight
- On the next day, freese DNA at -20C for future use
- DNA can be used to check concentration (Qubit) or directly into a PCR

# CO1 PCR 2022-11-2

## General Knowledge about PCR
- PCR reactions with reagents and samples should be placed on ice
- Every set of reactions should have a positive and negative control. Positive control is a reaction with DNA from a sample to amplify for the specific primers. Negative control is reaction with water.
- Positive control: w1118 md 65 1

**PCR Steps**
- Place reagents and samples on ice
- Names and sample number from 13 to 18

*Calculating the n number for reactions*
- n = number of samples + 2 + 0.1% for error
- In this case, n = 12 + 2 + 1.4 = 15.4

*Calculating components to make a master mix*
- Master mix is a mixture contains all things needed for PCR reaction except the DNA
- This helps to reduce variability
- 5 uL GoTag mix * n = 5 * 15.4 = 77
- 0.25 uL forward primer * n = 0.25 * 15.4 = 3.85
- 0.25 uL reverse primer * n = 0.25 * 15.4 = 3.85
- 3.5 uL molecular grade water * n = 3.5 * 15.4 = 53.9

- Add them all to make a mixture
- Vortex and spin down the master mix and place on ice
- All reagents should be vortexed and spinned down before using
- Set up strip tubes for each sample and the controls
- Label tubes with sanmple number, indication to primer, and date
- Add 9 uL of master mix to each strip tube
- Vortex and spin down all DNA samples
- Add 1 uL of DNA from each sample to their respective reaction tube
- Add 1 uL of molecular grade water to the negative control tube
- Add 1 uL of the positive control DNA to the positive control tube
- Vortex all strip tubes and spin them down

- Turn on the PCR machine and navigate to the needed program (already set up in the system)
- Close caps securely and place the strip tubes in the machine
- Make sure the green rach is on the correct side, all tubes are placed perfectly in holders
- Close the lid and start the program with a volume of 10 uL
- Record the run time on the screen
- After the process is done on the machine (12C), take the samples out and store at 4C on a labeled red rack

# Running Gel for DNA Practice 2022-11-4

## Knowledge about Running Gel

- Agarose gels are used to visualize DNA, usually after PCR or other enzymatic reaction.
- DNA is loaded into wells in the gel and pulled through the gel matrix with a positive charge current.
- The DNA is stained and visualized under UV light.
- The size of the gel depends on the number of samples runned.
- The percentage of the gel depends on the expected band size of the DNA learned.

*Note*
- The DNA stain is often mutagenic. It is an agent that attach into DNA to glow, can also damage DNA.
- Thus, it is important to wear gloves.
- The UV light is also harmful.
- Make sure to cover the light box with the plastic cover.

## Gel Sizes and Specifications:

### Small Square Gel:

- Maximum number of samples: 11
- Number of ladder spaces: 1
- Volume needed: 20 mL
- Volume gel stain needed: 0.5 uL
- How to cast: use casting trays, fit the base into the square spot

### Small Rectangle Gel:

- Maximum number of samples: 24
- Number of ladder spaces: 1
- Volume needed: 30 mL
- Volume gel stain needed: 0.75 uL
- How to cast: use casting trays, fir the base into the rectangle spot

### Fisher Tall Rectangle:

- Maximum number of samples: 14
- Number of ladder spaces: 2
- Volume needed: 40 mL
- Volume gel stain needed: 1 uL
- How to cast: Turn sideways in the gel box and slide down half way, using the rubber liners to make a seal. Use the level on top of the scale to make sure it is flat. Not pushing dowm all the way makes it easier to take out.

### Large Rectangle (Red Stripes):

- Maximum number of samples: 38
- Number of ladder spaces: 2
- Volume needed: 70 mL
- Volume gel stain needed: 1.5 uL

### Largest Clear Rectangle:

- Maximum number of samples: 96
- Number of ladder spaces: 4
- Volume needed: 165 mL
- Volume gel stain needed: 5 uL
- How to cast: Use lab tape to make a seal around the edges. Put tape along the sides and seal it very tight by pushing a fingernail along the tape multiple times until you feel like it is sealed properly.

## Steps:

**Making Gels**

- Determine the % needed, usually 1-3%
- Determine the volume of gel liquid needed
- Depending on the volume, choose the appropriate certain sized Erlenmyer flask for best results:
+ 20-40 mL: 125 mL flask
+ 40-100 mL: 250 mL flask
+ 165 mL: 500 mL flask
-Based on the volume needed and the percentage gel, determine the needed agarose:
+ Example: 100 mL of a 1% gel needs 1 g of agarose
+ In this case, 0.4 g of agarose is needed (actually amount measured is 0.4120 g)
- Measure the agarose using the balance with a weight boat and scooper
- Pour the agarose into the desired dry Erlenmyer flask
- Measure the volume of 1X TAE needed needed for the liquid in the 100 mL graduated cylinder on the self
+ In this case, 40 mL of 1X TAE is used
+ 1X TAE can be made from water and 30X TAE
- Pour into the flask and swirl gently to mix the agar and liquid
- Put in the microwave
- Press time/ temp, 7 for the power, and 1 minute for the time (more liquid volume needs more time, and more % needs more time)
- Swirl to mix and check carefully to see any bubbles and flakes. The liquid should be completely dissolved and clear. Chips are very hard to see. These chips make the liquid not homogenous and DNA move differently, affect results. Can microwave more if needed.
- Wait to cool down (1 min, 3-5 min, 5-10 min) before pouring to the tray
- Add an appropriate amount of DNA gel stain (lab solution), 1.0 uL in this experiment before pouring (kept at 4C and shoould be in liquid state) to the liquid flask and mix
- Gently pout the liquid into the casting tray, avoid bubbles
- Put the comb in and make sure it is sitting in evenly (can be before pouring liquid if prefered)
- USe the pipettee tip to move bubbles to the side or bottom if needed
- Wash the flask immediately in tap water, then DI water
- Wait 10-15 minutes for it to solidify

**Loading the Gel**

- Gently take the combs out vertically and rinse in DI water and place to dry
- Take the tray out of the casting device, remove tape
- Fully submerge the gel in the gel box in 1X TAE buffer (can add more if needed). Make sure the wells are on the side of the box with the black electrode (negative charge). DNA is negative charged and will move to the potive charge (red)
- Red and purple papers help to see the wells clearer
- Load 3 uL of ladder (Gene ruler 1 kb plus ladder or other types) into the first well
- Load in 5 uL of other samples (8 in this case) in a known order, put other ladders if needed
- Close the lid of the gel box
- Plug it into the power station with color matching
- Change the time and voltage (volt is "like" speed, over 100 is too fast)
- In this case, 35 minutes at 90 V
- After starting the power station, make sure to see bubbles in the gel box
- First gel: ladder, samples 25 to 32
- Second gel: ladder, samples 33 to 36, N, P

**Imaging the Gel**

- Turn off the power station, unplug the wires
- Take the tray out and take to the imager
- Slide the gel onto the UV light box without touching (can use extra gloves to avoid EtBr contamination)
- Rinse the tray in DI water and place to dry
- Cover the gel box
- Turn off the room light
- Turn the UV light on with extra gloves and take picture using phone
- Turn off UV light, take off the cover
- Place the gel in the gel trash bucket
- Rinse the light box with DI water, wipe with paper towel
- Put trash into the second trash bucket with gloves
