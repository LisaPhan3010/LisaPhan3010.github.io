# Fusing Endogenous PICH Gene with mNeon

**Preparing Plasmids**

- Warm up the plate AmpR in the incubator for 5-10 min.
- Use autoclaved "toothpick" to get a tiny amount from frozen tube and stretch in Z motions on plate (each for each quarter of the plate).
- Discard toothpick into a beaker for later clean.
- Incubate at 37C to form colonies
- Close fridge.

*Make Liquid Culture*

- List of plasmids (can find it on the lab computer):
+ pYA1443 - PICH NT - mNeON - PuroR Amp
+ pYA1094 - PICH gRNA2 Amp (guide)
+ pYA1277 - PICH gRNA4 Amp (guide)
+ pYA1365 - PICH gRNA5 Amp (guide)

- Take out media Amp, tubes, tips and get ready.
- Add 3 mL of media to each tube (8 tubes) using pipet.
- USe tip, pick the isolated one and put the whole tip into the tube (2 tips for each tube).
- Seal plate with parafilm, put it and media into fridge.
- Put prepared tubes in 37C incubator with shaker and heater overnight.

- Get ready for DNA extraction the next day.

**DNA Extraction of Plasmids**

- Transfer culture to 20 mL tubes (8 of them)
- Centrifuge at 5000 rpm for 5 min to see pellet
- Use all culture for this step
- Discard the liquid after that
- These steps can be repeated until finished

- Follow all the instructions in QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit protocol (Quick Start Protocol, QIAGEN)

**Mini Drop 9-8-2023**

- This step is performed to record absorbance/ concentration
- First, drop 1 uL of water for blank
- Then, measure for all plasmids
+ 1443: 396.2 ng/uL
+ 1365: 212.5 ng/uL
+ 1094: 158.5 ng/uL
+ 1277: 225.5 ng/uL
- Clean the machine with a kim wipe gently
- Keep the plasmids at -20C

**ViaFect Reagent Transfection**

- 9-11-2023, split cells from 5cm dish to a 3.5cm dish with a confluency of 25% (to have 50% the next day)

**Reagents**|**Concentration/Amount**|**Volume**
:------:|:---------:|:----------:
Plasmid 1443|0.5ug=500ng|1.26uL
Plasmid 1094|0.5ug|3.15uL
Plasmid 1277|0.5ug|2.22uL
Plasmid 1365|0.5ug|2.35uL
ViaFect|-|8uL
Opti-MEM (media without FBS)|-|183.02uL (total of 200uL)

- Mix them all in a 1.5mL tube, tap well, and leave at room temperature for 20 min

- Change media for the cells
- Add dropwise of transfection mix into the plate
- Mix well and leave in incubator for 2 days

- 9-14-2023, split cells from 3.5 cm dish (80%) to 2 of 10 cm dish (20%), 500 uL per dish
- Also split cells in the reserved plate, take out all cells

- 9-15-2023, add antibiotic selection
- Stock Puromycin is 10 ug/mL, the needed Puromycin is 2 ug/10mL
- Thus, 2/2 x 10 = 2 uL, take 2 uL for each dish
- Drop and swirl

- 9-16-2023, change media and add antibiotic again

- 9-18-2023, change media and add slective antibiotic

- 9-20-2023, change media and add selective antibitotic (1uL instead)

- 9-22-2023, 1uL
